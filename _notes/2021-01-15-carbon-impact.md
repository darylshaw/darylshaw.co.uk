I was nodding along as I read each section of Brian's post [Green by Default](https://blr.design/blog/green-by-default/). Found via [Calibreâ€™s Performance Newsletter](https://www.calibreapp.com/newsletter).

I love the [low impact website](https://lowimpact.organicbasics.com/) by Organic Basics that he shared.

I [plant trees](https://ecologi.com/darylshaw?r=5e31ae19be60350017c7e239) every month and try to make better choices to reduce my carbon footprint. [My website](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/darylshaw-co-uk/) can do with improvement.
