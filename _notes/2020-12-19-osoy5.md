I find [Facebook attacking Apple](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/facebook-attacks-apple-s-ios-changes-in-full-page-newspaper-ads) over an iOS update, in the name of small businesses… comical.

I have thoughts on targeted advertising that have been brewing since the Summer. I’ll find time to finish pulling them together in 2021 maybe.
