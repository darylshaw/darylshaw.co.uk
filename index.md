Hey, I’m Daryl. I’m an independent technical marketing consultant based in South East London.

## About me

The main focus of my work is around the technical side of marketing, PPC, and front-end development. For me technical marketing covers tech SEO, analytics and tag management through to conversion optimisation, migrations and replatforming.

Whether you need transparent consultancy, a deep-dive audit or a best practices healthcheck. I can work with you to help you achieve your goals.

Examples of areas where I'm probably not best placed to help:

* Off-page SEO
* Content production
* Audience research

I can add value and offer guidance. But where I'm happiest is on-page.
