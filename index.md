Hey, I'm Daryl. I'm a London-based technical marketer and web developer. I like finding solutions to businesses problems. Need help? [Let's talk](/contact).

## About me

I've been working on the web since ~2013. Helping businesses manage their online presence. The majority of that time with a small agency working with ambitious businesses.

I did spend two-and-a-half years running a jewellery company in York. We were one of the first in the UK to sell diamonds grown in a lab.

Away from work you'll find me ~~supporting~~ suffering Newcastle. Out on a long-run. Or hitting the trails. I get out to run with [GoodGym](https://www.goodgym.org/) as much as I can.

### What I can offer
Here are the areas where I can help:

* Paid media management
* SEO
* Audits (technical SEO, content, paid media, Google Analytics, performance)
* Analytics & tag management
* Ongoing consultancy
* Migrations and replatforming
* Web development (WordPress, Jamstack)
* Website support & maintenance

## Work

* Built functionality for a clientâ€™s website to allow customers to order samples
* Helping a business of 30+ years to not only survive during a pandemic but grow and record their best month *ever*
* A successful domain migration that led to improved rankings and growth in traffic
